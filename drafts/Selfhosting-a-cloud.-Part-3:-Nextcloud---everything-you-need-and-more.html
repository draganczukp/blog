<h1>Short intro to Nextcloud</h1>
<p>
Nextcloud started as a fork of Owncloud. They both allow anyone to easily setup a cloud file storage server. While Owncloud aims to replace services like Dropbox or Google Drive, Nextcloud expands on the whole "cloud" idea. Currently Nextcloud can replace most of the G-Suite (Google's all-in-one solution for business and enterprise): file storage, image management, music library (using your own music files), calendar, contacts, document editing, instant messaging (including voice
and video calling) and much, much more.
</p>
<p>
The only thing that's really missing is a mail server, however given how easy it is to <a href="https://poolp.org/posts/2019-09-14/setting-up-a-mail-server-with-opensmtpd-dovecot-and-rspamd/">set up your own mail server</a>, I don't think that's necessary.
</p>
<p>
It also lets anyone create their own plug-ins (called "apps") which can provide almost anything you might need.
</p>
<p class="offtopic">
I'm often using "containers" and "images" interchangeably. I know that they are not the same, however for the purpose of this guide the differences are irrelevant.
</p>
<h1>Run Nextcloud in Docker</h1>
<h2>Choose which container to use</h2>
<p>
If you were to google "Nextcloud docker" you would quickly find that there are two dominant containers which provide Nextcloud. One of them is the official container created by Nextcloud developers. The other one is created by Linuxserver, a group of developers who provide high quality containers for a lot of different apps.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't really matter which one you choose. They both give you a Nextcloud installation with the exact same features. There are some differences, though:
<ul>
		<li>Tags and Dockerfiles: With the official image you can choose a specific <b>major</b> version you want to install, what OS it's based on and whether to use full Apache server or just FPM. It also supports a lot more platform (though most of them are not used by anyone).
		</br>
		Linuxserver on the other hand allows for more precise version choosing, with every release available as a separate tag. It also doesn't allow you to choose just FPM without a full server and the only supported architectures are: AMD64 (modern computers and servers) as well as armhf and arm64 for use with single board computers like Raspberry Pi</li>
		<li>Configuration through environment variables: The official image lets you configure database and an initial admin account using environment variables. Linuxserver doesn't allow any configuration like that (though I wish it did)</li>
		<li>Underlying base server: Official image uses either Apache with PHP or just PHP FPM. Linuxserver uses Nginx + PHP. I'm pretty sure that Linuxserver comes with a lot more PHP extensions installed, which can be required by some apps.</li>
</ul>
Ultimately the decission is yours. I prefer the Linuxserver container, so that's what I'll be using in this guide.
</p>
<h2>Writing a docker-compose file</h2>
<p>
Create a new folder to store your Nextcloud installation. In it create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.

</p>
<p>
Let's start by pasting an empty skeleton with no services:
<pre><code>
version: "3"
services:

networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
Now let's start by creating a database container. Nextcloud supports PostgreSQL and MySQL/MariaDB. I like MariaDB, so I'll be using that. You can choose whatever you want, but be aware that initial configuration for those containers can be different from what I write below.
</p>
<p>
The service definition isn't too complicated:
<pre><code>
nc_db:
  # I know that using 'latest' tag is not recommended, but whatever
  image: mariadb
	container_name: nc_db
</code></pre>
This is the bare minimum to run a database. Unfortunately, this will not work for us.
</p>
<p>
First, we need to use a volume for the database itself. Without it every time the container restarts all data would be lost. It's also a good idea to have the container worry about setting root (admin) password, creating a user for Nextcloud and creating an actual database based on environment variables. And it would be nice if the container restarted automatically after reboots.
</p>
<p>
In order to do all that we need to expand the docker compose file a bit:
<pre><code>
version: "3"
services:
  nc_db:
	  image: mariadb
		container_name: nc_db
		env_file:
		  - nc.env # We'll create this file in a minute
		volumes:
		  - nc_db_data:/var/lib/mysql
		networks:
		  - nc
		restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  nc_db_data:

networks:
  nc:
	proxy:
	  external: true
</code></pre>
The only thing you might not know from before is the <code>volumes:</code> section. This allows you to create new volumes (persistent storage) managed by docker. By not providing any configuration to <code>nc_db_data</code> we tell docker-compose to use defaults, which work for 99% of cases.
</p>
<p>
Same goes for the <code>networks:</code> section. We need a network so that the database container and Nextcloud container can talk to each other. By default docker-compose puts every container from a single file in the same network, however the Nextcloud container will have to be in the <code>proxy</code> network so that it can be proxied by Traefik.
</p>
<p>
The <code>env_file</code> section might also be new to you. It simply lets you store environment variables in a separate file. This is really useful if you want to share your docker-compose files without worrying about leaking passwords.
</p>
<p>
You can run <code>docker-compose config</code> to verify the file.
</p>
<h3>Environment file</h3>
<p>
The <code>nc.env</code> file uses a key-value pair format. The contents of this file are as follows:<pre><code>
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=[Strong-and-complicated-password-123!@#]
MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
MYSQL_PASSWORD=[another-strong-password]
</code></pre>
</p>
<h2>Nextcloud container</h2>
<p>
Like I said before, we'll be using Linuxserver image in this guide. Add the following service definition to <code>docker-compose.yml</code>:
<pre><code>
nextcloud:
  image: linuxserver/nextcloud
	container_name: nextcloud
	volumes:
	  - ./data/data:/data # Yo dawg, I heard you like data...
		- ./data/conf:/config
  networks:
	  - proxy
		- nc
  environment:
	  - PUID=1000
		- PGID=1000
		- TZ={{TIMEZONE}}
  restart: unless-stopped
</code></pre>
I didn't include Traefik configuration just yet, as it's a bit complex. Right now I want to focus on Nextcloud itself.
</p>
<p>
You can change the <code>volumes</code> section so that it uses docker volumes for <code>/data</code> and <code>/config</code> instead of local directories, but this way makes backing up easier - just <code>tar</code> the whole <code>data</code> folder and store it somewhere safe.
</p>
<p>
The environment variables <code>PUID</code> and <code>PGID</code> make it so that you can read and write directly to the data folder. <code>TZ</code> is your Time zone. Set it according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">this table</a> to make sure the container has correct date and time.
</p>
<h2>Apply Traefik proxy</h2>
<p>
Due to how Nextcloud works the Traefik configuration isn't as straightforward as it is for most applications:
<pre><code>
labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"
  - "traefik.http.routers.cloud.entrypoints=https"
  - "traefik.http.routers.cloud.rule=Host(`cloud.example.com`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.cloud.tls=true"
  - "traefik.http.services.cloud.loadbalancer.server.port=443"
  - "traefik.http.services.cloud.loadbalancer.server.scheme=https"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.nextcloud.headers.customFrameOptionsValue=ALLOW-FROM https://cloud.example.com"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.nextcloud.headers.contentSecurityPolicy=frame-ancestors 'self' example.com,*.example.com"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.nextcloud.headers.stsSeconds=155520011"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.nextcloud.headers.stsPreload=true"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.nextcloud-redirect.redirectregex.regex=/.well-known/(card|cal)dav"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.nextcloud-webfinger.redirectregex.regex=/.well-known/webfinger"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.nextcloud-webfinger.redirectregex.replacement=/public.php?service=webfinger"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.nextcloud-redirect.redirectregex.replacement=/remote.php/dav"
  - "traefik.http.routers.cloud.middlewares=nextcloud,nextcloud-redirect,nextcloud-webfinger"
</code></pre>
The first 5 lines you should be familiar with. Enable Traefik, listen on HTTPS for this domain and TLS. Container listens on port 443.
</p>
<p>
The next line means that the container expects to get HTTPS requests instead of HTTP (the port doesn't matter here). I have no idea why Linuxserver set it that way, but whatever. The next lines create and apply some middlewares, which set some headers for usage with other apps, and redirect some specific paths to correct destinations.
</p>
<h2>Running and testing everything</h2>
<p>
Start the containers with <code>docker-compose up -d</code> and go to cloud.example.com (or whatever you configured in the Host rule). Go through the installation wizard choosing the correct database. Set the data folder to <code>/data</code>.
</p>
<p>The database host is <code>nc_db</code> and the database and username are both <code>nextcloud</code> using the password you set in <code>MYSQL_PASSWORD</code>.
</p>
<p>
You might want to untick the "Install recommended apps" checkbox. If it's checked then Nextcloud will install some apps you might not need, as well as a server for Onlyoffice or Collabora. Both of these servers are useless for real world usage and you can install Collabora in docker later.
</p>
<h2>Adding some recommended configuration to config.php</h2>
<p>
While this step isn't usually needed, it can help with some issues. Edit the file <code>data/conf/www/nextcloud/config/config.php</code>. The two important settings are <code>trusted_domains</code> and <code>overwrite.cli.url</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>trusted_domains</code> should be an array containing your domain. For example:
<pre><code>
'trusted_domains' =>
  array (
    0 => 'cloud.example.com',
	),
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
<code>overwrite.cli.url</code> should be the full URL of your Nextcloud instance, for example:
<pre><code>
'overwrite.cli.url' => 'https://cloud.example.com',
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
The one good thing about PHP is that you don't have to restart anything. Save and exit from the config file and refresh the page in your browser. If everything still works, then we're pretty much done.
</p>
<h1>The end</h1>
<p>
As you can see, installing Nextcloud is really easy, and it's probably one of the more difficult services to install. Most services will be installed in almost the same way: define the service, add database, create necessary volumes, add Traefik labels, and just <code>docker-compose up -d</code>.
</p>
<p>
Now all that's left for you is to go through available apps and installing the ones you want.
</p>
<h1>Addendum</h1>
<p>If you want to use a centralised service for user management in Nextcloud and other services, you might want to look into Keycloak (which I'll cover in part 6) or Active Directory/OpenLDAP (which I'll cover if/when I get it working). In any case, I recommend you don't use Nextcloud too much untill you have the user management working, as messing with users can lead to data loss.</p>
