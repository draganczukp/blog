<h2>What is DWM?</h2>
<p>
DWM is a dynamic tiling window manager created by guys at <a href="https://suckles.org">https://suckless.org</a>. The "dynamic tiling" part means that windows are arranged based on certain predefined rules. This is different from floating window managers (like xfwm4, the window manager for the XFCE desktop environment), where each window can occupy any part of the screen and overlap other windows. If you want more information on tiling vs floating WMs, take a look <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obzf9ppODJU">here</a>, where a YouTuber named Distrotube made an hour
long video about tiling WMs.

The thing that makes DWM stand out from other, more popular WMs, like i3, is the simplicity, at least in term of code. It's written in plain C, it doesn't exceed 2000 SLOC, doesn't contain most of the "nice" things to have, like transparency, gaps around window, and the most important one: it doesn't use any external config files. Each change requires you to recompile and restart the whole thing.

<h2>How to install it?</h2>
<p>
While it might be tempting to install DWM with your distributions package manager, it's not a good idea if you want to change anything at all (unless you want to use the package just for installing dependencies, in which case go ahead).

Installing is simple. Download the source, compile, install and run. Here's a step by step guide:

<h2>How do you configure it?</h2>
<p>
You're probably thinking that in order to use it you have to learn C and dig deep into the source code just to change some key bindings. Luckily, this is not the case. While it looks intimidating at first, the configuration is not that much more difficult that configuring something like i3. You still change one text file, it's just that the syntax is a bit different and you have to recompile to see your changes.
