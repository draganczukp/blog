		<h2>A non comprehensive guide to DWM</h2>
		<article>
<h2>What is DWM?</h2>
<p>
DWM is a dynamic tiling window manager created by guys at <a href="https://suckles.org">https://suckless.org</a>. The "dynamic tiling" part means that windows are arranged based on certain predefined rules. This is different from floating window managers (like xfwm4, the window manager for the XFCE desktop environment), where each window can occupy any part of the screen and overlap other windows. If you want more information on tiling vs floating WMs, take a look <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obzf9ppODJU">here</a>, where a YouTuber named Distrotube made an hour
long video about tiling WMs.
</p>
<p>
The thing that makes DWM stand out from other, more popular WMs, like i3, is the simplicity, at least in term of code. It's written in plain C, it doesn't exceed 2000 SLOC, doesn't contain most of the "nice" things to have, like transparency, gaps around window, and the most important one: it doesn't use any external config files. Each change requires you to recompile and restart the whole thing.
</p>
<h2>How to install it?</h2>
<p>
While it might be tempting to install DWM with your distributions package manager, it's not a good idea if you want to change anything at all (unless you want to use the package just for installing dependencies, in which case go ahead).
</p>
<p>
Installing is simple. Download the source, compile, install and run. Here's a step by step guide:
<pre><code>
git clone https://git.suckless.org/dwm
cd dwm
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>
That's it. Now you just have to run it, either by writing (or copying from the Internet) a session file used by a display manager (sddm, gdm, etc.) or by adding <code>dwm</code> to your <code>.xinitrc</code> and running <code>startx</code> from tty.
</p>
<p>
You might also want to install <code>dmenu</code> (an application launcher) and <code>st</code> (terminal emulator from the suckless team)
</p>
<h2>Quick usage guide</h2>
If you've ever used any tiling window manager, especially a dynamic one with predefined layouts, you can probably skip this section.
<h3>Opening programs</h3>
<p>
Before we do anything, you need to know one thing: DWM is very keyboard centered and doing almost anything requires a key combination. All combinations use a modifier key, which by default is Alt (I'll show you how to change that later if you want). This means that whenever I say something like "press <code>MOD+p</code>" what I mean is "hold Alt and press p".
</p>
<p>
DWM has some default keys defined, which makes it "usable" out of the box. One of them is <code>MOD+Return</code> (<code>MOD+Enter</code>), which spawns a new terminal window. By default it's <code>st</code>.
</p>
<p>
Go ahead and open a few of them. Notice how the windows are laid out: One window always takes half the available space on screen, while the rest are stacked on top of each other. This is the default layout in DWM and it's called "Master and stack", you can probably see why: one
master window and a stack of smaller windows.
</p>
<p>
To kill the active window (the one highlighted by a border) you have to press <code>MOD+Shift+C</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you want to run a browser, you need to open an application launcher and then choose and launch it. It sounds complicated, but it's actually pretty easy and a lot faster than using GUI.
</p>
<p>
To open the application launcher press <code>MOD+P</code>, start typing the name of the browser and when it's highlighted press Enter. After a few minutes it becomes a second nature.
</p>
<h3>Windows management</h3>
<p>
You can move between windows using mouse, but, to quote a classic, ain't nobody got time for that! Using mouse requires you to lift your hand from the keyboard, move it to the mouse, move it and return your hand to the keyboard. That's like 2 seconds wasted! In order to move focus to a different window, press <code>MOD+j</code> and <code>MOD+k</code>. This moves focus to next/previous window in the list.
</p>
<p>
With <code>MOD+Shift+Return</code> you can exchange current window with the master window. Pressing <code>MOD+H</code> and <code>MOD+L</code> will resize the master window.
</p>
<h3>Tags</h3>
You're probably wondering what are those numbers on the top bar. They are indicators for tags and display some useful information about them.
<p>
<p>
Tags are DWM's way of organising windows into a kind of virtual workspaces. A window can be tagged with one or more tags. A window tagged with "1" will only appear when showing tag "1". A window tagged with "1" and "3" will be visible when showing either tag "1" or tag "3".
</p>
<p>
You can choose which tag is visible with <code>MOD+[1-9]</code> for single tag, or you can use <code>MOD+Control+[1-9]</code> to show multiple tags at once. Windows are automatically tagged to show on your currently selected tag
</p>
<p>In order to tag a window use <code>MOD+Shift+[1-9]</code>. This will set the window to that tag. <code>MOD+Shift+Control+[1-9]</code> will toggle additional tags.
</p>
<h2>How do you configure it?</h2>
<p>
You're probably thinking that in order to use it you have to learn C and dig deep into the source code just to change some key bindings. Luckily, this is not the case. While it looks intimidating at first, the configuration is not that much more difficult that configuring something like i3. You still change one text file, it's just that the syntax is a bit different and you have to recompile to see your changes.
</p>
<p>
Pretty much all the configuration for dwm happens in the file <code>config.h</code> in the source directory.
</p>
<h3>Sections of the config file</h3>
<h4>Appearance</h4>
<p>
This section contains the basic configuration for how DWM looks
<ul>
		<li><code>borderpx</code> - How big is the border around windows</li>
		<li><code>snap</code> - distance at which floating windows snap to edges</li>
		<li><code>showbar</code> - whether or not show the bar at the top</li>
		<li><code>topbar</code> - is the bar at the top (1) or at the bottom (0)?</li>
		<li><code>*fonts[]</code> - Fonts used in the bar</li>
		<li><code>dmenufont</code> - Font used by dmenu</li>
		<li><code>col_*[]</code> - colors</li>
		<li><code>*colors[][3]</code> - Color Scheme definitions. You probably shouldn't need to change it</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Tags</h4>
<p>
<code>*tags[]</code> defines how the tags are displayed in the bar. There should always be 9 of them, otherwise things will break.
</p>
<p>
<code>rules[]</code> defines where to put windows based on certain conditions
