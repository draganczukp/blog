 <article><h2>About this blog</h2><h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>My name is Przemek Dragańczuk. I live in Poland and I'm currently studying IT at Uniwersytet Zielonogórski.</p>
<p>I always liked computers, so naturally I went to an IT technikum (a specialised High School where you actually learn how to do something useful) in my home city, where I discovered just how great Linux is.
After a year from when I first learned how to use it, I installed Ubuntu on my PC, but it was so slow I decided to use a different distro. I randomly chose Manjaro and accidentally downloaded the i3 edition. I instantly fell in love with it, since on Windows I was already using as many keyboard shortcuts as possible.</p>
<p>
A couple months later I got bored of Manjaro and how it holds your hand with everything, so I decided to try installing Arch. The first time I did it I broke pretty much everything I could have broken during installation. The second time went better, but it still wouldn't work. After about 5th attempt I had a working system with i3 installed.
</p>
<p>
During the installing I learnt a lot about how Linux works and I finally stopped being afraid of the command line and embraced the shell. Since then I learned vim, then I switched to neovim and I didn't miss Windows and IDEs at all.
</p>
<p>
 Then I went to college and in order to make notes during lecture, a lot of which were Math, I learnt basic Latex.
</p>
<p>
If you're already bored, then I want to warn you, that I'm bad at writing and getting straight to the point, which in this case is: I'm trying to live as bloat free as possible, while not sacrificing anything I like.
</p>

<h3>What is this blog?</h3>

<p>
In this blog I'm talking about a lot of things, usually Linux and Linux software. I sometimes talk about programming or make tutorials on setting up some of the software I use. I'm not writing for little kids, so expect to see some swearing, especially when I'm complaining about something
</p>
<p>
This blog was written entirely in neovim on an Arch Linux PC (by the way I use Arch). It's also still work in progress, which is why some things don't look as good as they can, like the headings, which are too small or no visible border between posts and rest of the site.
</p>

<h3>What do I define is "bloat"?</h3>
<p>
My definition of bloat might be different from what others think, but it's really simple:
<ul>
	<li>Things that use more resources than they should, for example: all the electron apps, Google Chrome, Windows</li>
	<li>Things that have a fuck ton of features nobody asked for or needs. Just look at Instagram: What used to be a simple photo sharing app now has all these features, like stories or Instagram TV that 90% of users just ignore</li>
	<li>Anything that spies on its users, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc.</li>
	<li>All those websites that take 10 minutes to load because they have to download 100MB worth of frameworks and trackers before they can show you the content</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>What isn't bloat then?</h3>
<p>
	That big list might make you feel like there is no software I don't consider bloat, but that's not correct. There is a lot of software that no one would consider bloated, for example:
	<ul>
		<li>Linux: The kernel is huge and contains a lot of stuff most people don't use, but it's relatively easy to compile your own kernel without all that stuff. Even if you leave them, about 40MB for all the drivers I would ever need and a lot of other useful things is not that much</li>
		<li>(neo)Vim and CLI apps in general are fast, small and almost all the features are useful, even if not everyone knows about them</li>
		<li>Hundreds or thousands of apps that do just what they're supposed to do, like Mozilla Firefox, Geary, the entire Unix tool suite etc.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Bloat that I can't cut out of my life</h3>
<p>
Despite my hatred towards bloat, I still use a lot of bloated software. I use:
<ul>
	<li>gmail - only because I don't have the time to set up an email server on my VPS</li>
	<li>Windows - A lot of software I have to use in cullege (like 3DSMax) works only on Windows. Also, Linux is still not the perfect platform for gaming, at least not yet</li>
	<li>Facebook and messenger - Simply for communication with my classmates. If you say that we should use something else, you try to tell about 30 student that they should stop using the communicator they used for years and they use to talk with almost everyone and use something maybe one of them heard about before. I'll wait here and laugh at you with them</li>
	<li>Spotify - I haven't found any other way to listen to music everywhere without problems that's just as cheap and, what's more important, legal</li>
</ul>
</p></article> <article><h2>How I make this blog</h2><h3>The blog script</h3>
<p>
I created a shell script that handles most of the things related to blogging, like creating a post and publishing it. It does not use a database (unless you count plain text files) and employs a lot of sed bullshitery to make it all work.
</p>
<p>
The whole script is available on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/draganczukp/blog">here</a>. Just set the variables to suit your needs
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Running the script by itself shows a menu with a few options, which can be passed as arguments instead.</p>
<p>The option "c" asks for a post title, then creates an empty draft and opens it in default editor, which for me is nvim. The draft is just a HTML file, but without the whole html skeleton (things like doctype, head or opening/closing body tags).</p>
<p>Once you're done writing the post, you are asked if you want the post to be marked for publishing. This just copies the draft to another
folder, which helps keep ready posts separate from posts that still need some work.</p>
<p>Posts can be later edited using option "u" (for update), which lists all posts to choose from with FZF.</p>
<p>You can also use "d" to permanently delete a post. It is currently not possible to unpublish a post once it has been published from the script. You have to delete it from "published" folder manually.</p>
<p>Once you have a couple of posts ready, you can render them with "r". This does three things:
<ul>
	<li>create finished .html files for each published post (like this one) by loading a template and replacing specific things with a post</li>
	<li>Create a list of links to all the rendered posts</li>
	<li>Create a big page with every single post one after another</li>
</ul>
I might also add RSS to the mix, but I don't know if anyone will use it.
</p>
<p>
The last step is deploying the blog with "u" (or running <code>./deploy</code> directly). For me it copies specific files to my VPS using scp, then runs a build script with ssh, but you can chage it to do whatever you want.
</p>
<p>
That's it. All you have to do is set your server to show your blog and you're done.
</p>

<h3>OMG you copied Luke Smith's lb!!!11!!1!one!oneone!</h3>
<p>
Yes, I did base my script on his. I saw what he did and I thought to myself: "I can do that too". So I did. Mine isn't as compact as his and depends on FZF, but it has some extra features, like being compatible with every web server, not just Apache.
</p>
<p>
Besides, I treat Luke as a mentor who taught me a lot of things, like Vim text objects, sed and Latex. I use a lot of snippets copy-pasted from his dotfiles into mine and they are great little things I would never have thought about
</p>
<p>
If Luke doesn't like the fact that I practically copied his script, he can contact me through multiple means. Github issues would be the simples way.
